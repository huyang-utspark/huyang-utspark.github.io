<span style="font-family:Consolas; font-size:1.35em;"> I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/about) at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/about) supervised by [Prof. Mohit Tiwari](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~tiwari/). I am also working closely with [Prof. Sarfraz Khurshid](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~khurshid/). My research interests lie in program analysis, software security, automated reasoning and machine learning.</span>

<span style="font-family:Consolas; font-size:1.35em;"> Before Ph.D. at UT Austin, I was working with [Prof. Abhik Roychoudhury](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~abhik/) at National University of Singapore, and [Prof. John C.S. Lui](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cslui/) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. I received my bachelor's and master's degrees with honors from Xi'an Jiaotong University.</span>
